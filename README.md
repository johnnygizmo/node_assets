### Please be aware that these are made on the daily build of Blender which can be found at https://builder.blender.org

Hey Everyone, welcome to my GitHub Repo! Feel free to clone these blend files and use these node groups in your projects or whatever! If you make something cool with them, be sure to show me on Twitter! Tag me @johnnygizmo

This repo works best if you clone it to a folder on your computer and then add that folder as a new asset library.
